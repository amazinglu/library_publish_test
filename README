note for publish library to bintray

    use the latest version of "com.github.dcendents.android-maven"
    and "com.jfrog.bintray"

    use Plugins {} instead of apply plugin

    get the gpg public key as well as the private key

        list key
            gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG

        public key command
            gpg --armor --export 092A156DB2009E05 (key Id)

        private key export command
            gpg --export-secret-keys -a

use the same setting as the Project level build.gradle and library level build.gradle
